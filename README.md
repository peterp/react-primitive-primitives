# Primitive Primitives

Somehow you've found this. That was not my intention. This is mostly
an experiment in making a design system that targets both react native and react-dom.

I think react-primitives is too complicated for my requirements. I'm going to make
use of the ability to alias packages with webpack to target different environments... Rather than building a smart package that switches automatically.
